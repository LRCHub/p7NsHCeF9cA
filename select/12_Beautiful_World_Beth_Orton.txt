Looks like you're never coming home
Looks like you'll make that road alone
Caught in the headlights of a very mixed up world
Where everything you fear is here
Where your shadow blocks your light

Oh, beautiful world to me
Beautiful world

Doves cried when she tried to fly
When her wings spread she heard their song
Flies to your flame but so hard to see at night
Alone in your dreams

Beautiful world
It's a beautiful world to me

It's a beautiful world
It's a beautiful world to you

Don't let me go outside tonight
Keep me safe within this room
Afraid of what I feel, afraid of what I'll do
Everything I feel is here
Where your shadow blocks the light

One embrace, one embrace
My heart, sometimes

It's a beautiful world
It's a beautiful world to you
