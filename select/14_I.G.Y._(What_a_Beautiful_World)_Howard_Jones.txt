(Donald Fagen)

Standing tough
Under stars and stripes
We can tell
This dream's in sight

You've got to admit it
At this point in time
That it's clear
The future looks bright

On that train
All graphite and glitter
Undersea by rail
90 minutes from New York to Paris
Well, by '76, we'll be a-okay

What a beautiful world this will be
What a glorious time to be free
What a beautiful world this will be
What a glorious time to be free

Get your ticket
To that wheel in space
While there's time
The fix is in

You'll be a witness to that
Game of chance in the sky
You know we've got to win

Here at home
We'll play in the city
Powered by the sun
Perfect weather for
A streamlined world
There'll be Spandex jackets
One for everyone

What a beautiful world this will be
What a glorious time to be free
What a beautiful world this will be
What a glorious time to be free
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

On that train
All graphite and glitter
Undersea by rail
90 minutes from New York to Paris
More leisure for artists everywhere

A just machine to make big decisions
Programmed by fellows
With compassion and vision

We'll be clean when their work is done
We'll be eternally free
Yes, and eternally young

What a beautiful world this will be
What a glorious time to be free
What a beautiful world this will be
What a glorious time to be free

What a beautiful world this will be
What a glorious time to be free
What a beautiful world this will be
What a glorious time to be free
